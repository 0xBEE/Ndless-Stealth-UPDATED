      =================================


This document is intended for maintainers of Ndless.

This file describes the prerequisites and setup steps for a development environment
to build Ndless.

You *don't* need to follow this procedure to set up a C/ARM development environment to
build TI-Nspire programs.

Toolchain
===

* Install MinGW which provides GCC for Windows: http://www.mingw.org/
* Make sure that the bin/ directory of MinGW is your PATH environment variable

Misc
====

* Copy /ndless-sdk/tools/MakeSyscalls/Makefile.config.tpl to Makefile.config and configure the latter

Building
========

Simply execute "make" in the main source directory.

Upgrading Ndless to a newer OS version
======================================

- Search in all the source code the marker string "OS-specific", and add
  the addresses for the new OS version
- Run "make clean; make" in the main source directory.
